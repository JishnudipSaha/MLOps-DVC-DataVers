1. Create a git repo and clone it in local.
2. Create mycode.py and add code to it. (it will save a CSV file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do git add-commit-push before initializing DVC
# pip install dvc
4. Now we do "dvc init". (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
5. Now do "mkdir S3" (creates a new S3 directory)
6. Now do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3", (here if you are working in S# in AWS then instead of writing S3 write the URL directly)
7. Next "dvc add data/"
    Now it wil ask to do: ("git rm -r --cache 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
    Because initially we were tracking data/folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
9. Now -> "dvc commit" and "dvc push"
10. Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
11. Now make changes to mycode.py to append new row in the data, check changes via "dvc status"
12. Again -- "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
13. Then git add-commit-push (We are saving V2 our data at this point)
14. Check dvc/git status, everything should be upto date.
15. Repeat steps 11-13 for V3 of data.
